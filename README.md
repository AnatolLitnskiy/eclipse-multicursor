What is this?
=============

A work-in-progress attempt to provide Sublime-Text-like multi cursor support for text editors in the Eclipse IDE.


What works?
-----------

* Multiple identical lines can be edited simultaneously using Eclipse linked mode editing (similar to existing "rename in file" functionality)


Next steps
----------

* "select next" functionality + associated editing using Eclipse linked mode

* "find next" + associated editing

* editing of non-identical text / editing without using linked mode

* split selection to lines

* regexp support for find next
